# Restaurnt Review
Restaurant Review is a Ruby on Rails web application that helps people decided where to go and not to go out to eat.
<br>
As someone who is always looking for new places to go out to eat, I always like to hear other people expierences there before trying a new place. Restaurant Review is the perfect place to be able to add your own reviews and check out others to help decide what restaurant you should try next!
<br>
As a user you can sign up, log in and log out. Once logged in you are able to view and review all restaurants added by other users, or add a new restaraunt yourself and review it for others to see. A user can also edit and delete and restaurant or reviews they posted themself.
